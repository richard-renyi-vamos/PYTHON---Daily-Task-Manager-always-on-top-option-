create a python code that shows 10 editable daily tasks . 

it should also needs an always on top button

Creating a Python application with editable daily tasks and an "Always on Top" feature can be achieved using a GUI library like Tkinter. Here's a basic structure of how the code could look:

Tkinter GUI: A simple and widely used library for building GUI applications in Python.
Editable Tasks: Use Entry widgets to allow editing of tasks.
Always on Top: A feature to keep the application window above all other windows.
Here's a basic implementation:

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk

def toggle_always_on_top():
    root.attributes('-topmost', not root.attributes('-topmost'))

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Daily Tasks")

# List to store task entries
tasks = []

# Function to create new task entries
def create_task():
    if len(tasks) < 10:
        task_var = tk.StringVar()
        entry = tk.Entry(root, textvariable=task_var, width=50)
        entry.pack()
        tasks.append(task_var)

# Create 10 tasks initially
for _ in range(10):
    create_task()

# Button to toggle always on top
top_button = tk.Button(root, text="Toggle Always on Top", command=toggle_always_on_top)
top_button.pack()

# Start the GUI event loop
root.mainloop()
To run this code, you'll need Python installed with Tkinter, which is typically included in standard Python distributions.

How It Works:
Creating Tasks: The create_task function creates an editable text entry for each task. It limits the number of tasks to 10.
Always on Top Toggle: The toggle_always_on_top function toggles the window's 'always on top' status.
Tkinter GUI: The application window is set up with a title, and the tasks and the toggle button are packed into it.
This is a basic implementation. You can further enhance it by adding features like saving tasks, setting priorities, or customizing the appearance. ☺👩‍💻📝

modify it so it shows the text "TASK" and a number from 1 - 10 at the beginning of every row
ChatGPT
Certainly! To modify the code so that each task entry is prefixed with "TASK" followed by a number from 1 to 10, we can simply adjust the create_task function to include a label next to each entry. Here's the updated code:

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk

def toggle_always_on_top():
    root.attributes('-topmost', not root.attributes('-topmost'))

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Daily Tasks")

# List to store task entries
tasks = []

# Function to create new task entries
def create_task():
    if len(tasks) < 10:
        task_number = len(tasks) + 1
        frame = tk.Frame(root)
        frame.pack()

        label = tk.Label(frame, text=f"TASK {task_number}: ", width=10)
        label.pack(side=tk.LEFT)

        task_var = tk.StringVar()
        entry = tk.Entry(frame, textvariable=task_var, width=40)
        entry.pack(side=tk.LEFT)
        
        tasks.append(task_var)

# Create 10 tasks initially
for _ in range(10):
    create_task()

# Button to toggle always on top
top_button = tk.Button(root, text="Toggle Always on Top", command=toggle_always_on_top)
top_button.pack()

# Start the GUI event loop
root.mainloop()
Changes Made:
Frame for Each Task: Each task (a label and an entry widget) is now placed inside a Frame. This makes it easier to organize them side by side.
Task Label: A label tk.Label is created for each task, displaying "TASK" followed by the task number.
Entry Adjustment: The Entry widget's width is adjusted to fit alongside the label.
This code will display each task with a label like "TASK 1", "TASK 2", and so on, next to an entry field where you can type the task details. The 'Always on Top' functionality remains the same. 😊📋🔢
